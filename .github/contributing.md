## Project Setup

1. Fork this repo, then clone your forked repo to your machine.

   ```bin
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/eslint-configs.git
   ```

2. Make sure you are always in sync with this original repository.

   ```bin
   # do this once
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ruppyio/eslint-configs.git

   # do this whenever you want to sync with original repository
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main
   ```

   > This will add the original repository as a remote called `upstream` while remote to your forked repo is usually called `origin` when you clone it by default.
   >
   > Do regular sync with original repository.
   >
   > If you want to push the synced local to your forked repo, do this command:
   >
   > ```bin
   > git push origin main
   > ```

3. Install dependencies using `yarn`.

   ```bin
   yarn
   ```

4. Run the test.

   ```bin
   yarn test
   ```

4. Create new test for new feature or test the new fix.
